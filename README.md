# apprenticeship-2022_01_11-2-task-calculator

I was genuinely amused by this task, as I had been working on a calculator before. That was several months in the past, but I found that to be helpful regardless.

This is the last project that I had started with the versioning scheme that is seen here. While needing more time to get used to how Git works and not being quite that familiar with it, I have finally embraced a versioning scheme that adheres much more accurately to Semantic Versioning after this project.

For clarification to the uninitiated, b008 does not have a proper version number because it is an incomplete build. Since I have deleted all the files right after uploading all of their content to the main branch, not considering the "release" section here on GitHub, I will not bother with releases and properly marking complete and incomplete builds as such, lol

I may never return to this, as I would probably just write a calculator from scratch if I feel like making one.
